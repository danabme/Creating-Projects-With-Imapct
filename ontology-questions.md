# Questions that Drive the Ontology

I want to build a general ontology for textbooks.  I want the ontology to be driven by the key questions that a person would ask about a textbook.  Please generate  list the 100 most common questions that users might ask about a textbook.  Exclude any questions that are specific to any domain.

Here are some samples of non-domain specific questions about a textbook that the ontology should answer:

1. What is the title of the textbook?
2. Who is the audience of the textbook?
3. What are the prerequisites for this textbook?
4. What are the core concepts taught in this textbook?
5. What is the order that these core concepts should be taught?
6. What are the key learning objectives for this course?
7. Using Bloom's Taxonomy 2001, classify each concept into one of the levels.
8. For a student that has the right prerequisites, how long would a student take to cover all of the concepts in this textbook?
9. For any given concept C show a definition for that concept in the context of this textbook.
10. Give an example of how concept C is used in this in this textbook.
11. What are the key outcomes of this course.  State it in the term of "After this course the student will be able to..."
12. What new types of content will the students be able to create after they use the textbook for a course?
13. For each concept C, show lesson plans L for student with a background B.
14. For each concept C, show sample multiple-choice assessments A.
15. For each concept C, list the relevant microsimulations M.
16. For each microsimulation M, list the related concepts C.
17. For each concept C, list the related stories S.
18. For each concept C, list the related metaphors "Metaphor"
19. For each concept C, list the related generative AI "Prompts" P.
20. For the textbook, list the chapters in the textbook in the order they are presented.
21. For each chapter, list the concepts C covered in that chapter.

Now list about 80 more similar questions.
