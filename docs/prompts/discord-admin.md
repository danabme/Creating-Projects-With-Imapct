# Discord Admin

!!! prompt
    I am a total rookie at running a Discourd server for a great group of people that are working together to build intelligent textbooks using Learning Graphs.  What suggestions do you have for me to setup a great Discord site for these wonderful people from around the world?


I'll help you create a comprehensive Discord server structure that caters to an international community focused on intelligent textbooks and learning graphs. Based on the context from your documents, I'll provide specific recommendations.

Here's a suggested server structure and tips:
