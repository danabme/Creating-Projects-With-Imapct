    Next, I would like you to create a 10-classification taxonomy system to classify each Concept. For example here are some suggestions: 1. Foundation Concepts 2. Terms and Definitions 3. Mkdocs Build Process 4. Material Features

## Response

Below is one possible 10-classification taxonomy system for the 150 concepts. This taxonomy is designed to broadly categorize the concepts into thematic groups that represent different aspects of creating and managing an intelligent textbook using Mkdocs and the Material theme.

**Proposed 10-Class Taxonomy:**

1.  **Foundation Concepts**
    Core ideas, initial concepts, and baseline understandings of intelligent textbooks.

2.  **Terms & Definitions**
    Basic terminology, standard definitions, and conceptual frameworks (graphs, embeddings, etc.).

3.  **Mkdocs Setup & Configuration**
    Concepts related to installing, configuring, and organizing Mkdocs projects (directories, YAML config, build process).

4.  **Material Theme & UI Customization**
    Concepts that involve the Material theme's features, navigation structures, color palettes, and layout customization.

5.  **Markdown & Content Formatting**
    Concepts focusing on Markdown usage, linking, images, tables of contents, admonitions, and equation formatting.

6.  **Interactivity & Multimedia**
    Concepts for embedding interactive elements, multimedia content, simulations, quizzes, and MicroSims.

7.  **Advanced Features & Integrations**
    Higher-level concepts such as semantic search, embeddings, vector stores, chatbots, and concept graphs.

8.  **Deployment & Publishing**
    Concepts on hosting (GitHub Pages, custom domains), CI/CD (GitHub Actions), versioning, large media handling, multi-language support, and exporting formats.

9.  **Analytics, Personalization & User Experience**
    Concepts related to analyzing user behavior, personalizing lessons, recommendations, feedback forms, and improving engagement.

10.  **Accessibility, Localization & Future Outlook**
    Concepts that address accessibility (WCAG), assistive technologies, localization, machine translation, and future-proofing strategies.
