Word clouds for intelligent textbooks are graphic images that display the most important concepts in a book where the size of the font is related
to how frequently the concept appears in the textbook or
how important the concept is in the textbook.

Wordclouds MicroSims can be easily be generated by generative AI applications.

Here is a sample prompt to generate a wordcloud

## Basic Prompt
!!! prompt

    the with the most important word or phrases given a score of 70.

## Prompt 2: Provide the List of Words

## Prompt 3: Provide the Wordlist Code

Use the following to link from the word to the glossary term:

```javascript
const wordList = wordData.map(([label, weight]) => {
    return [
        label,
        weight,
        () => window.location.href = `../../glossary#${label.replace(/\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase()}`
    ];
    });
```

Note that this converts the entire string to lowercase and replaces the spaces with a dash
to conform to the standards used by mkdocs-material.
