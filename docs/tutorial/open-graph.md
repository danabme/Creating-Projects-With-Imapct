# The Open Graph Metadata Standard

I'll help you understand Open Graph metadata standards for your intelligent textbooks built with mkdocs-material. This will enhance how your content appears when shared on social media platforms.

## Open Graph Protocol Standards

Open Graph is a protocol that enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. Originally created by Facebook in 2010, it's now widely used across many platforms including Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.

The Open Graph protocol uses meta tags in the HTML `<head>` section of your website to define how your content should be represented when shared on social media. Here are the core Open Graph tags:

### Basic Open Graph Tags

- `og:title` - The title of your page/article
- `og:type` - The type of content (e.g., website, article, book)
- `og:image` - The URL of an image to represent your content
- `og:url` - The canonical URL of your page
- `og:description` - A brief description of your content
- `og:site_name` - The name of your overall site

## Default Social Usage

You can just add the social plugin

```yml
plugins:
    - social
```

### Implementation in mkdocs-material

To add a custom Open Graph tags to your mkdocs-material site
you'll need to create a custom template. Here's how:

1. Create a directory called `overrides` in your project root
2. Create a file `overrides/main.html` with this content:

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block extrahead %}
  <!-- Open Graph / Facebook -->
  <meta property="og:type" content="website">
  <meta property="og:url" content="{{ page.canonical_url }}">
  <meta property="og:title" content="{{ page.title }} - {{ config.site_name }}">
  <meta property="og:description" content="{{ page.meta.description or config.site_description }}">
  <meta property="og:image" content="{{ config.site_url }}img/social-preview.png">
  
  <!-- Twitter -->
  <meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
  <meta property="twitter:url" content="{{ page.canonical_url }}">
  <meta property="twitter:title" content="{{ page.title }} - {{ config.site_name }}">
  <meta property="twitter:description" content="{{ page.meta.description or config.site_description }}">
  <meta property="twitter:image" content="{{ config.site_url }}img/social-preview.png">
{% endblock %}
```

3. Update your `mkdocs.yml` to use your custom template:

```yaml
theme:
  name: material
  custom_dir: overrides
```

### Page-specific Metadata

For page-specific descriptions, you can add front matter to each markdown file:

```markdown
---
description: A detailed explanation of how to integrate MicroSims in your intelligent textbook.
---

# Your Page Title
```

### Best Practices for Open Graph Tags

1. **Image Dimensions**: Use images that are at least 1200Ã—630 pixels for optimal display
2. **Description Length**: Keep descriptions between 70-200 characters
3. **Unique Images**: Create unique images for important pages
4. **Testing**: Use the [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) or [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator) to test your tags

### Example for a MicroSim Page

For a MicroSim page, you might use:

```markdown
---
title: Sine Wave Visualization MicroSim
description: Interactive simulation demonstrating sine wave properties with adjustable frequency and amplitude parameters.
image: /img/sims/sine-wave-preview.png
---

# Sine Wave MicroSim
```

!!! note
    The metadata block that begins and ends with three dashes MUST be the first lines in the markdown file.

And in your custom template, you'd add:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="{{ page.meta.image or config.site_url }}img/social-preview.png">
```

This approach ensures your intelligent textbooks and MicroSims will have rich previews when shared on social platforms, increasing engagement with your educational content.
