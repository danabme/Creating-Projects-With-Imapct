# Glossary of Terms for mkdocs for Intelligent Textbooks

#### Admonition

A section of text that is separate from the main flow of text.

Admonitions are designed to that they can be quickly skipped over
if the user is not concerned with the topic.

In mkdocs-material admonitions are used to store text such as abstracts, 
note, info, tip, success, question, warning, failure, danger, bug, example and quote.

#### Automatic Build

Using an automatic process that generates HTML from the markdown files.

Automatic builds for mkdocs can be automatically executed whenever any part of the mkdocs.yml or the files
in the ```docs``` directory change.  On GitHub, a GitHub action can be configured to achieve this.

#### Navigation

In our textbooks we focus on left-side navigation systems since these
are the default navigation system and they are both intuitive and
familiar by our users.  Our users also tend to be using
screens that are wide landscape displays.  We discourage top navigation.

#### Quiz Management

Allow pages to contain self-assessments where the answers are hidden until the user
clicks on a "Show Answer" control.

Allow multiple-choice questions in a list to use the ordered-list labels A. B. C. D.

#### Search

Create a search function as part of the build process.

The mkdocs material theme generates a reverse index JSON file that is used to
list the pages that match search keywords.

Note that standard mkdocs search does not use embeddings and there is no
way to find similar documents.
