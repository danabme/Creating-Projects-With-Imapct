1.  **Static Content Level** - Basic text with minimal formatting
2.  **Structured Content Level** - Content organized into meaningful structures
3.  **Visual Representation Level** - Data and concepts presented visually
4.  **Basic Interaction Level** - Initial interactive elements
5.  **Simulation Level** - Dynamic modeling of concepts
6.  **Advanced Simulation Level** - Complex, personalized interactions

Detailed Breakdown
------------------

### Static Content Level

1.  **Text Block** - Plain text in paragraph form
2.  **Enhanced Text** - Text with basic formatting (bold, italic, headers)

### Structured Content Level

3.  **List Structure** - Bulleted or numbered lists that organize information
4.  **Definition Structure** - Term-description pairs that clarify concepts
5.  **Tabular Structure** - Information organized in rows and columns

### Visual Representation Level

6.  **Static Visualization** - Charts, graphs, and diagrams that don't change
7.  **Toggle Visualization** - Charts with options to switch between different views
8.  **Process Visualization** - Workflows and sequences shown with connecting elements

### Basic Interaction Level

9.  **Animated Visualization** - Visual elements with predetermined movement
10.  **Interactive Infographic** - Clickable areas that reveal additional information
11.  **User-Controlled Animation** - Animations with basic user controls (play/pause)

### Simulation Level

12.  **Basic MicroSim** - Simple interactive simulation with limited controls
13.  **Standard MicroSim** - Simulation with multiple controls and realistic modeling
14.  **Data-Enhanced MicroSim** - Simulation that captures user interaction data

### Advanced Simulation Level

15.  **Adaptive MicroSim** - Simulation that adjusts to user behavior or preferences
16.  **Personalized MicroSim** - Simulation tailored to user's knowledge level
17.  **Immersive Simulation** - Comprehensive 3D environment with complex interactions
