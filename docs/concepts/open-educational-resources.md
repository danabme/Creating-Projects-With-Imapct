# Open Educational Resources

**Open Educational Resources (OER)** are freely accessible, openly licensed educational materials that can be used, adapted, and redistributed by anyone. They are designed to support teaching, learning, and research without the typical restrictions of traditional copyrighted educational content.

#### **Key Characteristics of OER:**

1.  **Free Access** -- Available at no cost to users.
2.  **Open Licensing** -- Typically licensed under Creative Commons or similar licenses, allowing modification and redistribution.
3.  **Diverse Formats** -- Can include textbooks, videos, quizzes, simulations, course modules, and full online courses.
4.  **Customization** -- Educators can adapt content to fit specific learning needs.
5.  **Scalability** -- Institutions and individuals can distribute OER widely without legal or financial barriers.

### **Is There a Central Listing of OER?**

There is no single, universally recognized **central repository** for OER, but several well-known platforms and organizations curate and distribute them:

#### **Major OER Repositories and Platforms:**

1.  **OER Commons** (<https://www.oercommons.org>) -- A broad collection of open educational materials for various subjects and levels.
