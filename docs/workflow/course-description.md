# Beginning with a Course Description

We begin the textbook generation process starting with a detailed course description that outlines the target audience, prerequisites, learning objectives, and scope of content. This document forms the foundation for all subsequent development stages.

## Structure of a Course Description

New course descriptions can be created by an individual author from scratch.  In general they have
the following structure.

**Course Title** - such as "Introduction to Deep Learning with Python"

**Target Audience** - such as "High school or college students that want to learn Deep Learning"

**Prerequisites** - a list of prior knowledge concepts that should be mastered before they take this course.  **Example:** Python programming

**Course Description** - a narrative summary of what the course covers, teaching methodology, and key outcomes. **Example:** "This hands-on course introduces students to deep learning fundamentals through practical Python programming..."

**Learning Objectives** - specific skills or knowledge students will gain by the end of the course. 

**Example:**

-   Understand fundamental neural network architectures
-   Build classification models using TensorFlow or PyTorch
-   Apply deep learning to real-world datasets
-   Evaluate and optimize model performance


**Topics Covered** - main subject areas or modules in the course. 

**Example:**

-   Neural network basics
-   Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
-   Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
-   Transfer learning
-   Ethics in AI

**Course Duration** - length and format of instruction (8 weeks, 40 hours total, online/in-person)

**Assessment Methods** - how student progress is evaluated (projects, assignments, exams)

**Tools/Software Required** - technical requirements (Python 3.x, Jupyter notebook, specific libraries)

**Credits** - academic credit value if applicable

**Instructor Information** - relevant qualifications and experience
