# Generating a Course Taxonomy

!!! prompt
    Now lets focus again on the enumerated-concepts.md file we have generated for a course.
    Your task is to organize these concepts into a small taxonomy
    of approximately a dozen classifiers.  You will generate a list
    of the classifier labels.

    Here are some suggestions.  
    
    The first category is "Foundational Concepts".
    These are concepts that are introduced at the start of the course
    and are considered prerequisites.
    
    A second category is "Concept Definitions" where we introduce new terms.
    A last category is "Miscellaneous".
    Your task is to create the rest of the classifiers and give each classifier a label and definition.
    Each category should include concepts that share similar characteristics, functions, or applications.
    Attempt to evenly divide the 150 concepts into a balanced taxonomy.

    Suggest 10 categories for the taxonomy and assign each concept
    to one or more categories. Add an 11th category called "Miscellaneous".
    Ensure that the categories cover
    a range of concept types, including abstract ideas, practical
    applications, common misunderstandings, and real-world examples.
    Avoid redundancy and ensure that each category is distinct.
